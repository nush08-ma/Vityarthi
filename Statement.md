# Project Statement: Student Database Management System
## 1. Problem Statement
   
In many small educational institutions, coaching centers, and classrooms, student records are still managed using manual methods such as notebooks.


1. Due to which they may face problems such as:

2. Data Redundancy & inconsistency: Hard to keep track of duplicate entries.

3. Data Loss Risk: Notebooks can be damaged or lost.

4. Inefficiency: Searching for a specific student or updating a grade in a notebook is time-consuming.

There is a critical need for a digitized solution to manage student records effectively.

## 2. Scope of the Project
This project aims to develop a project using Python and SQLite to manage student records.

-  Database : Creation of a relational database schema to store student attributes (ID, Name, Age, Grade).

-  Functionality: Implementation of full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

-  Data Persistence: Ensuring data remains available even after the application is closed.

## 3. Target Users
This system is designed for:

-  School Administrators: For maintaining records in small schools.

-  Private Tutors or Coaching Centers: To maintain student records.

-  Class Teachers: To maintain a digital log of their specific class performance.

## 4. High-Level Features
The system includes the following core capabilities:

-  Student Enrollment (Add): Allows the user to capture and store new student details including Name, Age, and Class/Grade.

-  Display data (View): Fetches and displays a formatted list of all students currently registered in the system.

-  Academic Updates (Update): Enables the modification of a student’s grade/class as they progress or if errors need correction.

-  Record Removal (Delete): Provides the ability to permanently remove a student's record from the database using their unique ID.

-  Automated Setup: automatically checks for and creates the necessary database file and tables on first run, requiring no manual SQL setup.
